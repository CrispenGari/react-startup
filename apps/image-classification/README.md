# What is this?

This is a simple Machine learning React app that classifies images from a provided URL using a pre-trained model from tensorflow called `@tensorflow-models/mobilenet`. This application is cappable of identifying images from a given picture that will be provided as a URL.

## How to open the deployed Application?
[Click Here](https://image-classification-web.web.app) to open the deployed version of this application.

## This app is using

- Tensorflow.js
- Material-ui for front-end icons, cores components and lab components
- React.js

## Installation of required dependencies

## Installation of Material-ui using `npm`

`$ npm i @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab`

## Installation of Material-ui using `yarn`

`yarn add @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab`

## Installation of tensorflow required dependencies `npm`

`$ npm i @tensorflow/tfjs-core @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/mobilenet @tensorflow/tfjs-converter`

## Installation of tensorflow required dependencies using yarn

```
$ yarn add @tensorflow-models/mobilenet
$ yarn add @tensorflow/tfjs-core, @tensorflow/tfjs-converter
```

# How to test this application. (still working on it)

### Clone this repository using the following command:

`git clone [URL to this repository]`

### Navigate to the project folder of this app by running the following command:

`cd image-classification `

### Install the dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

### Then:

`npm start or npm run start`

### The react development server will start listening on port 3000 click the following URL:

URL: [test application](http://localhost:3000)

## Why this simple application?

This application was created for development and practice purposes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
